# Bird Watcher
Bird Watcher is an iOS app that helps you learn about birds you come across outside. After finding a bird, take a picture of it and the app will identify the bird's species, giving you information about it and even its bird call!

# How does it work?
Bird Watcher was trained using the Keras machine learning library on the [Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html). The model was converted for the CoreML Swift library and integrated with the iPhone camera so that pictures taken are saved and then run through the model resulting in a prediction.

# Who is it for?
Anyone wanting to get outside and learn about nature and birds should use this app!

# How to use it?
Bird Watcher will be coming to a local app store near you
